# Karatsuba Multiplication in C

This project implements **Karatsuba Multiplication**, a fast divide-and-conquer algorithm for multiplying large integers.  
The implementation is written in **C** and demonstrates efficient recursive algorithm design.

Karatsuba reduces the number of recursive multiplications, achieving a time complexity of  
**O(n<sup>log₂3</sup>)**, which is significantly faster than the traditional **O(n²)** multiplication method for large numbers.
